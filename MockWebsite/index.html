                <h4>About the Website</h4>  
                <p>Welcome to the Burning Band unofficial newsletter. My name is Nicolas Obregon and as a student of UOL, I have decided that for this project I would make a newsletter for a band from hy hometown, Bogota. This band has existed for quite some time, but only until recently have I learned about it, and as a fan of Latin American Death Metal, I thought it would be fun to make this little project. Naturally, some concepts will be not real and will not reflect the band in reality.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>New Album Announced 2021</h4>
                <p>Burning has announced in their website that a new album is currently in production, and will be released in early 2021. The unfortunate situation the world is in right now has given our beloved band members the opportunity to dedicate vast amounts of time into creating a new album. Not a lot of information about the album has been revealed now except for the expected date of release. One thing is for sure however, it will be &#128293 INFERNAL! &#128293</p>

                <h4>Information about Covid-19</h4>
                <p>Due to the ongoing pandemic. It is unfortunate for us to announce that all remaining concerts for 2020 have been canceled. However, this has only allowed the band to dedicate time to bringing us a whole new album straight from the depths of hell. Stay tuned for more information!</p>
                <br>
                <h4>2021 Tour Announced</h4>
                <p>Considering Burning is recording a new album, they have released a whole new set of touring dates for the latter half of 2021. As they are expecting for the situation to be more calm by the time that comes, surely concert halls and metal bars will already be open. If we stay home and take care of ourselves, the sooner we can go back to having a beer with our friends and sacrificing goats under the moonlight.</p>
